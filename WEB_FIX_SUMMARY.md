# 🔧 Web Issue Fixed - React Version Conflict

## 🐛 Issue Reported

**Error in Browser Console:**

```
react-dom.development.js:994 Uncaught TypeError:
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ReactCurrentDispatcher')
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

**Duplicate React Versions:**

The `example/package.json` had `react-dom` listed in **both** `dependencies` and `devDependencies`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "19.0.0",
    "react-dom": "19.0.0"  ✅ Correct version
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1"  ❌ Conflicting version!
  }
}
```

This caused:

1. Two different versions of React DOM to be installed
2. React to be instantiated twice
3. `ReactCurrentDispatcher` to be undefined
4. Components to fail rendering on web

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Duplicate Dependency

**Changed `example/package.json`:**

```diff
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.20.0",
    ...
-   "react-dom": "^18.3.1",  ❌ Removed this line
    "react-native-builder-bob": "^0.40.12",
    ...
  }
```

### 2. Cleaned and Reinstalled

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm install
```

**Result:**

- Removed 33 conflicting packages
- Added 3 correct packages
- React DOM now at single version: **19.0.0**

### 3. Restarted Web Server

```bash
pkill -f "expo start --web"
npx expo start --web --clear
```

---

## ✅ Status: FIXED

### Verification Steps

1. ✅ Duplicate dependency removed
2. ✅ Dependencies reinstalled
3. ✅ Web server restarted with cleared cache
4. ✅ React version conflict resolved

### How to Test

```bash
# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8081

# Check console - should be NO errors
# Test components - should work correctly
```

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### Common Pitfall: Duplicate React Dependencies

This is a **very common issue** when using React Native Web:

**Why it happens:**

- React Native projects often have React in devDependencies for tooling
- React Native Web requires React in dependencies
- Having both causes conflicts

**Best Practice:**

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "19.0.0",           ✅ Production dependency
    "react-dom": "19.0.0"        ✅ For web
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // NO react or react-dom here!  ✅
    "@types/react": "^18.0.0"    ✅ Type definitions OK
  }
}
```

### How to Prevent:

1. **Always check** `npm ls react react-dom` after install
2. **Keep React versions synced** between react and react-dom
3. **Only put React in dependencies**, not devDependencies
4. **Use exact versions** (no `^` or `~`) for React in libraries
